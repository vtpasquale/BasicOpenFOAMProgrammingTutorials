    The Finite Volume Method in Computational Fluid Dynamics
    F. Moukalled, L. Mangani, M. Darwish

    Chpater 7 Exercise 3 (Page 206)
    Use blockMesh to setup a uniform mesh similar to the one in Fig. 7.12 for L = 1. In
    OpenFOAMÂ® and then in uFVM do the following:

    (a) Write a program to read the mesh and loop over all boundary patches. Then
    for each patch print the centroid and normal vector of its faces.

    (b) Modify the program to define a volumeScalarField T. Set the values for T at
    element centroids and at the boundaries to 10x2y2, where x and y are the
    coordinates of the element centroids and for the case of the boundary the
    centroids of the boundary faces.

    (c) Write a program to compute the gradient of T and compare its value with the
    analytical solution.
